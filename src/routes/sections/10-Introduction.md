- 🏇 it's compatible with form libraries
- 🧩 fully customizable

The library uses [colord](https://github.com/omgovich/colord) internally because it's the lightest color conversion library on the market at the time and supports a11y contrasts and [svelte-awesome-slider](https://github.com/Ennoriel/svelte-awesome-slider) to display sliders.
